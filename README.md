# Fourier Series Animation

An interactive React web app that demonstrates how an arbitrary user-inputted line drawing can be approximated using the Fourier series. The concept is modelled through the visualisation of rotating vectors put end-to-end, with the Fourier series being used to determine the magnitude, rotational frequency, and initial position of each vector.

Inspired by [3Blue1Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) explaining and demonstrating the topic
